## Renan's Nathan Sort

The main objective of this repository is to improve my programming skills and apply the knowledge gained in the Algorithms Analysis and Design course. Furthermore, it aims to compare different sorting algorithms and test them in various scenarios.

### Algorithms:

- [x] Insertion Sort
- [x] Selection Sort
- [x] Merge Sort
- [x] Quick Sort
- [x] Counting Sort
- [x] Radix Sort
- [x] Heap Sort

### Stable Algortihms:

The following algorithms are stable. This means that if there are equal values in the original list, their order will be preserved in the sorted list.

✔️ Insertion Sort
✔️ Selection Sort
❌ Merge Sort
❌ Quick Sort
✔️ Counting Sort
✔️ Radix Sort
❌ Heap Sort
